## Get Started
**Overview**  
Project implements famous methods in Machine Learning MLP and KAN and compares their efficiency  
This particular implementation classifies polygons. results of the classification can be found in `/results` folder. It uses data generated by python functions particularly images of `28x28`.  

For more in-depth explanation navigate to ``theoretical_analisys`` folder and open the file with ``.html`` extension

### Usage
#### Install Dependencies in project directory run the following
``pip install numpy``  
``pip install torch``  

Navigate to the `main.py` folder and run `Polygon.draw_with_coords` function. this will populate your `/data` folder.  
``example - draw_with_coords(triangle, 2, 5, size=5)`` random values will work  

after define your ``main.py`` like so, play around with the parameters

```
# load images and corresponding labels
images, labels = load_images(5, "geometric_figures")

# define arguments for analysis
epochs = 50
hidden_layers_mlp = [20]
hidden_layers_kan = [64, 32, 16]
learning_rate = 0.001
# eye is set to 5 by default, output layer
model_analysis(images, labels, epochs, hidden_layers_mlp, hidden_layers_kan, learning_rate) // tests both of the models

```
