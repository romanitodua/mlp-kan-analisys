This particular implementation classifies polygons. results of the classification can be found in `/results` folder. It uses data generated by python functions particularly images of `28x28`.

### Usage
Navigate to the `main.py` folder and run `Polygon.draw_with_coords` function. this will populate your `/data` folder.
